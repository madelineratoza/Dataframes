## The idea in one sentence

A **data frame** is a table where **each row is one observation** and **each column is one variable**, designed so you can ask and answer questions with code.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why data frames matter

Most analysis tasks become easier when your data is in a consistent table:

-   You can **filter** (keep certain rows)
-   You can **select** (keep certain columns)
-   You can **summarize** (compute counts, averages, percentages)
-   You can **group** (compare subgroups fairly)

In other words: clean data frames turn “I wonder…” into “I can test that.”

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## A tiny example

Below is a simple data frame that looks like exam/course data.

``` R
library(dplyr)

df <- tibble::tibble( student_id = c(101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106), term = c("Fall", "Fall", "Fall", "Spring", "Spring", "Spring"), course = c("MSK I", "MSK I", "Neuro I", "MSK I", "Neuro I", "Neuro I"), final_grade = c(92, 68, 85, 74, 88, 61) )

df
```

## How to think about the structure

**Rows: “What is one row?”**

In this example, one row is **one student in one course in one term**.

That choice matters: it determines what questions you can answer cleanly.

**Columns: “What is one column?”**

Each column should represent **one concept**:

-   `student_id` identifies who

-   `term` describes when

-   `course` describes what

-   `final_grade` is the outcome we care about

## Questions you can answer (and the code patterns)

1\) How many rows are in the dataset?

``` R
nrow(df)
```

2\) What are the column names?

``` R
names(df)
```

3\) What is the average final grade overall?

``` R
df %>%
  summarize(avg_grade = mean(final_grade))
```

4\) What is the average grade by course?

``` R
df %>%
  group_by(course) %>%
  summarize(
    n = n(),
    avg_grade = mean(final_grade)
  )
```

5\) Which students are below 70?

``` R
df %>%
  filter(final_grade < 70)
```

## A simple “data frame checklist”

Before analyzing, ask:

1.  **Is one row one thing?** (one student-course-term? one exam attempt? one clinic visit?)

2.  **Are columns variables, not sentences?**

3.  **Are values consistent?** (e.g., `Fall` vs `fall` vs `FA`)

4.  **Do you have an ID?** (student, course, exam, location, etc.)

5.  **Are missing values handled intentionally?**

## Takeaway

A good data frame is less about “formatting” and more about **making your questions computable**.\

If you choose the right row definition and consistent columns, your analysis becomes a set of repeatable steps.
